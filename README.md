# PeopleManager

Please find the summary of the components I was able to complete.

    1. People CRUD - Teacher and Student
    2. Implemented Material Design
    3. Adaptive to both orientation and screen sizes (I did test a few different device - small, medium and extra large)

Things I believe I can improve on

    1. Decouple activity with computation logic (Have implemented to some extent, I believe I can work on it more)
    2. Better project architecture - In a quick short time, the implemented was the best possible I was able to come up with
    3. Better graphics - I only used the inbuilt ones

The total time I worked on this project was 3 hours and 32git  minutes in multiple sessions (Whenever I had free time)
